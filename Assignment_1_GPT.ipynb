    "# Operations and Supply Chain Analytics - Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due:** 5:00pm Eastern Time, March 31 (Sunday)  \n",
    "**Submission:** Submit both a write-up and your Excel files electronically on Canvas.  \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook presents my solutions to the first assignment for the \"Operations and Supply Chain Analytics\" course. The assignment encompasses a range of problems designed to test our understanding and application of supply chain and operations analytics concepts, including office location optimization, production network planning, transport optimization, and inventory management. The solutions herein leverage Python and its libraries, such as PuLP for linear programming, to model and solve the given problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1: Office Location and Consultant Assignment\n",
    "  - In this problem, SC Consulting must decide on the optimal location of its home offices and the number of consultants to assign to each office, with the goal of minimizing costs. The problem considers annual fixed costs of locating offices, expected number of trips to each state, and travel costs from each potential site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2: Production Network for StayFresh\n",
    "  - StayFresh, a refrigerator manufacturer in India, needs to plan its production network evolution over the next five years to accommodate anticipated demand growth. The problem involves deciding on capacity expansion at existing and potential plant sites, considering variable production and transport costs, as well as one-time capacity expansion costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3: Optimal Engine Load\n",
    "  - Harley-Davidson transports engines from its assembly plant in Milwaukee to its motorcycle assembly plant in Pennsylvania using trucks. The problem requires determining the optimal number of engines to load onto each truck, considering transportation costs, engine costs, and annual holding costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 4: JIT Manufacturing Impact\n",
    "  - As part of a just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing initiative, Harley-Davidson has reduced the number of engines loaded on each truck. The problem asks to analyze the impact of this decision on annual inventory costs and determine the optimal truck cost for the given load of engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 5: Green Thumb Manufacturing Decision\n",
    "  - Green Thumb, a manufacturer of lawn care equipment, has introduced a new product with a normally distributed demand. The problem involves determining the optimal number of units to manufacture, considering manufacturing costs, selling price, holding costs, and salvage value of unsold units. The goal is to maximize expected profit and estimate the average number of customers turned away due to stockouts."
